Eventually work with flask to create a web interface for the bot. Should allow for an easy an way to do actions without needing excel allowing me to move away from it and onto a proper database finally. A web interface would solve a lot of problems.


The invite link for the bot: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1012077296515039324&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

Schedule sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BAWa3vwD20Q_92kWG_jZlMIkMXgQlF5piot4TYnmscE/edit?usp=sharing



BOT INSTRUCTIONS MESSAGE:

With the new bot mission makers can now add their ops to the schedule themselves. They can also edit the ops currently on the schedule.

The command to add an op to the schedule is /reserversunday and takes two arguments. One for the mission name and one for the author name. (Please remember to use tab to autocomplete the arguments after the command. Should show up as small boxes you can write in.)

The command to edit an op on the schedule is /editsunday and takes no arguments. It should give you some prompts automatically when you run it.

The command to easily and quickly add roles written about in your announcement as reactions is to right click your message, hover over apps, and then press "Add signups".

The command to get reactions and signups in a nice and easily digestible way is like above but instead pressing "Get signups". Then it'll generate an excel sheet for you after some seconds. This will soon also include the training tags of the people that signed up next to their names.

NOTE: For results from the DLC poll, consult the link below. It should dynamically update every hour with the new responses.
