Eventually work with flask to create a web interface for the bot. Should allow for an easy an way to do actions without needing excel allowing me to move away from it and onto a proper database finally. A web interface would solve a lot of problems.


The invite link for the bot: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1012077296515039324&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
